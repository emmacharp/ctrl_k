Hello. This is the single most useful extension you need for Symphony. Ditch the navigation and start using CTRL + K.

Features:
- CTRL + K (Yeah, it's a feature, fight me.)
- `new <YOUR SECTION NAME>` Guess what it does. (Don't let me do all the work)
- `edit <YOUR SECTION NAME>` Read the above feature.

bye.
